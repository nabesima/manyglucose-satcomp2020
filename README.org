ManyGlucose 4.1-60 is a deterministic portfolio parallel SAT solver
for shared memory multi-core systems. Given an instance, a
deterministic solver has reproducible results in terms of solution
(satisfying assignment or proof of unsatisfiability) and running
time. ManyGlucose supports such reproducible behavior.
